# Credits

Predator is primarily developed by V0LT. However, this wouldn't be possible without the effort of dozens of other projects. This document contains credits to all of the software and people Predator depends on to function.


## Individuals

## Software

### OpenALPR

OpenALPR is the basis for Phantom, which is the license plate recognition engine at the heart of Predator. Without OpenALPR the entire Predator project wouldn't have been possible.

### FFMPEG

FFMPEG is one of the most powerful video processing tools currently available, and it's what gives Predator it's ability to quickly process large amounts of video. Predator uses FFMPEG to process recorded videos in both pre-recorded and real-time mode.
